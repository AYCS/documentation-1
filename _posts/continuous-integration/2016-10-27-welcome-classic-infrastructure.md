Welcome to Codeship's Classic Infrastructure with pre-configured VMs where we take care of the infrastructure for you. We host the environment, you provide the code.

## Getting Started
The screenshot below shows the initial [dashboard](https://app.codeship.com/projects) after logging in for the first time.

You can choose whether you want to import from GitHub or Bitbucket repository. Afterwards, you can enter a set of commands and/or choose some basic pre-configured commands according to your stack.

For significant speed improvements, you will have the option to check out our [ParallelCI trial](https://codeship.com/features/parallelci) in order to run tests in parallel and deploy faster. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7ujcuGtRjo) to find out more about ParallelCI.

The next steps for Classic Infrastructure are about [deployment](https://documentation.codeship.com/continuous-deployment/) and more fine-grained settings which can be found in our [continuous integration](https://documentation.codeship.com/continuous-integration/) chapter.
