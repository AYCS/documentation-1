We have a step by step guide on [Continuous Deployment of a Rails app from GitHub to Heroku](http://blog.codeship.com/2013/09/26/how-to-deploy-a-ruby-on-rails-app-from-github-to-heroku.html). Though we are using GitHub in the tutorial it is easy to get this running with BitBucket as your source code provider.

If you are interested in other languages and hosting providers please check out the [Deployment Academy](http://blog.codeship.com/category/deployment-academy) on our blog.
