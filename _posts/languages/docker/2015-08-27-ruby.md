In this article you will learn about setting up a Ruby based project, including Rails projects,
on our Docker infrastructure. We will set up testing with Rspec and Cucumber, but the same applies
to any other Ruby testing framework.

{% markdown docker/services_and_steps.md %}

## Dockerfile
We will start by creating a Dockerfile that lets you run your Ruby based test suite in Codeship.

{% markdown docker/caching_documentation_hint.md %}

Following is an example Dockerfile with inline comments describing each step in the file.

```Dockerfile
# Article for Dockerfile at ADD_URL_FOR_THIS
# We're using the Ruby 2.2 base container and extend it
FROM ruby:2.2

# We install certain OS packages necessary for running our build
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -yq \
      # NodeJS needs to be installed for compiling assets
      nodejs \
      # libpq-dev is necessary for installing the pg gem
      libpq-dev \
      # libmysqlclient-dev is necessary for installing the mysql2 gem
      libmysqlclient-dev

# INSTALL any further tools you need here so they are cached in the docker build

# Create a directory for your application code
RUN mkdir /app

# Set the WORKDIR so all following commands run in the above mentioned directory
WORKDIR /app

# Set the Rails Environment to test
ENV RAILS_ENV test

# COPY Gemfile and Gemfile.lock and install dependencies before adding the full code so the cache only
# gets invalidated when dependencies are changed
COPY Gemfile ./
COPY Gemfile.lock ./
RUN bundle install -j20

# Copy the whole repository into the container
COPY . ./
```

{% markdown docker/tool_documentation_hint.md %}

## codeship-services.yml

The following example will use the Dockerfile we created to set up a container
we call project_name (please change to your specific project name) that will run your build.
We're adding a Postgres and Redis container so the tests have access to those two services.

{% markdown docker/container_hostname_warning.md %}

```yaml
project_name:
  build:
    image: organisation_name/project_name
    dockerfile_path: Dockerfile.ci
  # Linking Redis and Postgres into the container
  links:
    - redis
    - postgres
  # Set environment variables to connect to the service you need for your build
  environment:
    - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@postgres/YOUR_DATABASE_NAME
    - REDIS_URL=redis://redis
# Service definition that specify a version of the service through container tags
redis:
  image: redis:2.8
postgres:
  image: postgres:9.4
```

{% markdown docker/additional_services_hint.md %}

## codeship-steps.yml

Now we're going to set up our steps file that contains a parallelised build configuration.

Every step in a build gets its own clean container and linked services. Any setup
commands that are necessary to setup a linked container (e.g. Database migrations)
need to be run for every step. While this duplicates some of the work it also makes
sure your parallelised test commands run completely independently.

As a step can only have a single command the best way to set up the build is through
scripts in your repository. You can then call those scripts in your step file.

In the following example we're testing an application with Cucumber and Rspec. We
also use brakeman to search for vulnerabilities and load our development seed data to make sure
that doesn't break.

```yaml
- name: ci
  type: parallel
  steps:
  - name: features
    service: project_name
    command: script/ci features
  - name: specs
    service: project_name
    command: script/ci specs
  - name: brakeman
    service: project_name
    command: script/ci brakeman
  - name: seeds
    service: project_name
    command: script/ci seed
```

And here is the corresponding script file you can put into script/ci

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: script/ci [command]
# Run the test suite on a Codeship build machine.

# This makes sure the script fails on the first failing command
set -e

# Create and init the database
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate

case $1 in
spec)
  bundle exec rspec spec
  ;;
features)
  bundle exec cucumber features
  ;;
brakeman)
  bundle exec brakeman
  ;;
seed)
  bundle exec rake db:seed
  ;;
esac
```

## Parallelisation with the parallel_tests gem

To get the most speed out of your builds you can use the parallel_tests gem
to automatically split up your test suite in different containers.

The following example will split your specs and features into two parts each.
By setting the SPLIT_NUMBER on each split we define which group of tests should
be run in this split. We're setting the TOTAL_SPLITS inline for each command,
you can also set it in the environment settings of the main container in your
codeship-services.yml

```yaml
- name: ci
  type: parallel
  steps:
  - name: specs_1
    service: project_name
    command: bash -c "TOTAL_SPLITS=2 SPLIT_NUMBER=1 script/ci spec"
  - name: specs_2
    service: project_name
    command: bash -c "TOTAL_SPLITS=2 SPLIT_NUMBER=2 script/ci spec"
  - name: features_1
    service: project_name
    command: bash -c "TOTAL_SPLITS=2 SPLIT_NUMBER=1 script/ci features"
  - name: features_2
    service: project_name
    command: bash -c "TOTAL_SPLITS=2 SPLIT_NUMBER=2 script/ci features"
  - name: brakeman
    service: project_name
    command: script/ci brakeman
  - name: seeds
    service: project_name
    command: script/ci seed
```

And here the corresponding script/ci file that will run each group of specs
and features.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Usage: script/ci [command]
# Run the test suite on a Codeship build machine.

# This makes sure the script fails on the first failing command
set -e

# Create and init the database
bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate

case $1 in
spec)
  parallel_rspec -n $TOTAL_SPLITS --only-group $SPLIT_NUMBER spec
  ;;
features)
  parallel_cucumber -n $TOTAL_SPLITS --only-group $SPLIT_NUMBER features
  ;;
brakeman)
  bundle exec brakeman
  ;;
seed)
  bundle exec rake db:seed
  ;;
esac
```
