# Codeship Documentation Template

Please 

## Tutorials & Setup guides
### Introduction
Write a brief introduction summary of the topic in which this document will cover

### Prerequisites (as needed):
A list of tools and topics the users should have knowledge of prior to beginning the tutorial. A link for additional information about each listed item must be included.

### TOC

### Step-by-step instructions:
Provide step-by-step instructions along with appropriate screenshots and code snippets from the beginning until the end. When creating a code block, make sure to assign the proper syntax highlighting to the language you are displaying.

Steps Example: [Deploy via Custom Script](https://codeship.com/documentation/continuous-deployment/deployment-with-custom-scripts/)

Code block example:
```
```ruby
def something
     return nil
end
```
```

### Conclusion
Cover any notices, reminders, troubleshooting tips, best practice on codeship, etc, that would normally not be covered in a “setup instructions” format but would be good information for the user to know.
