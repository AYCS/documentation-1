Welcome to Codeship's Classic Infrastructure with pre-configured VMs where we take care of the infrastructure for you. We host the environment, you provide the code.

## Getting Started
After having created a new project and connected to the repository as described in the [getting started with projects]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _general/projects/getting-started.md %}) article, you can enter a set of commands and/or choose some basic pre-configured commands according to your stack.

For significant speed improvements, you will have the option to check out our [ParallelCI trial](https://codeship.com/features/parallelci) in order to run tests in parallel and deploy faster. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7ujcuGtRjo) to find out more about ParallelCI.

The next steps for Classic Infrastructure are about deployment and other fine-grained settings.
